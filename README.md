## What is this project about?
I try to build a Rest API Backend with Node.js. Just out of curiosity. The goal is to know how much effort and time it consumes to have a good basic application with all the important stuff working.

## Dependencies
* Node.js (w. ES modules)
* express
* MongoDB

## Todo
* find purpose :grin:
